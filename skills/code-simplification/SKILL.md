# Code Simplification

This is a maintained adaptation of Addy Osmani's `code-simplification` skill. Attribution and the
MIT license are in `NOTICE.md` and `LICENSE.txt`.

> Inspired by the [Claude Code Simplifier plugin](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-plugins-official/blob/main/plugins/code-simplifier/agents/code-simplifier.md). Adapted here as a model-agnostic, process-driven skill for any AI coding agent.

## Overview

Simplify code by reducing complexity while preserving exact behavior. The goal is not fewer lines — it's code that is easier to read, understand, modify, and debug. Every simplification must pass a simple test: "Would a new team member understand this faster than the original?"

## Kit integration

This skill runs during Stage 6 against the complete current target-to-tree candidate, materialized in
the clean review tree required by the conductor. It is review-only: identify and explain candidate
simplifications and the equivalence checks they require; do not edit files, create commits, split
pull requests, or perform landing actions. The parent or author applies accepted cleanup to the
candidate, then reruns affected reviews against the resulting tree. Keep the review inside the
one-feature scope and changed code; unrelated refactors are out of scope.

Preserve observable behavior, including output shape and types, serialization, side effects and
ordering, and synchronous versus asynchronous error timing. Examples in this skill are illustrative,
not permission to change those properties; accept such a change only when equivalence is explicitly
proven for the project. Removal is a candidate suggestion only when code is confirmed unreachable,
non-public, and owned by the current candidate. Exported, public, or externally consumed code is not
dead based only on a local search. When deadness, ownership, or public API impact is uncertain,
leave the code in place, record the uncertainty, and escalate it without blocking the rest of the
review.

## When to Use

- After a feature is working and tests pass, but the implementation feels heavier than it needs to be
- During code review when readability or complexity issues are flagged
- When you encounter deeply nested logic, long functions, or unclear names
- When refactoring code written under time pressure
- When consolidating related logic scattered across files
- After implementation, before landing, when the candidate may contain duplication or inconsistency

**When NOT to use:**

- Code is already clean and readable — still run the review and report that no simplification is warranted; do not invent cleanup
- You don't understand what the code does yet — comprehend before you simplify
- The code is performance-critical and the "simpler" version would be measurably slower
- You're about to rewrite the module entirely — simplifying throwaway code wastes effort

## The Five Principles

### 1. Preserve Behavior Exactly

Don't change what the code does — only how it expresses it. All inputs, outputs, side effects, error behavior, and edge cases must remain identical. If you're not sure a simplification preserves behavior, don't make it.

```
ASK BEFORE EVERY CHANGE:
→ Does this produce the same output for every input?
→ Does this maintain the same error behavior?
→ Does this preserve the same side effects and ordering?
→ Do all existing tests still pass without modification?
```

### 2. Follow Project Conventions

Simplification means making code more consistent with the codebase, not imposing external preferences. Before simplifying:

```
1. Read CLAUDE.md / project conventions
2. Study how neighboring code handles similar patterns
3. Match the project's style for:
   - Import ordering and module system
   - Function declaration style
   - Naming conventions
   - Error handling patterns
   - Type annotation depth
```

Simplification that breaks project consistency is not simplification — it's churn.

### 3. Prefer Clarity Over Cleverness

Explicit code is better than compact code when the compact version requires a mental pause to parse.

```typescript
// UNCLEAR: Dense ternary chain
const label = isNew ? 'New' : isUpdated ? 'Updated' : isArchived ? 'Archived' : 'Active';

// CLEAR: Readable mapping
function getStatusLabel(item: Item): string {
  if (item.isNew) return 'New';
  if (item.isUpdated) return 'Updated';
  if (item.isArchived) return 'Archived';
  return 'Active';
}
```

Do not replace an object accumulator with a `Map` merely to reduce syntax: that changes output
shape, serialization, and often the consumer contract. A candidate must preserve the established
collection type and observable iteration behavior unless the project explicitly proves equivalence.

### 4. Maintain Balance

Simplification has a failure mode: over-simplification. Watch for these traps:

- **Inlining too aggressively** — removing a helper that gave a concept a name makes the call site harder to read
- **Combining unrelated logic** — two simple functions merged into one complex function is not simpler
- **Removing "unnecessary" abstraction** — some abstractions exist for extensibility or testability, not complexity
- **Optimizing for line count** — fewer lines is not the goal; easier comprehension is

### 5. Scope to What Changed

Default to simplifying recently modified code. Avoid drive-by refactors of unrelated code unless explicitly asked to broaden scope. Unscoped simplification creates noise in diffs and risks unintended regressions.

## The Simplification Process

### Step 1: Understand Before Touching (Chesterton's Fence)

Before changing or removing anything, understand why it exists. This is Chesterton's Fence: if you see a fence across a road and don't understand why it's there, don't tear it down. First understand the reason, then decide if the reason still applies.

```
BEFORE SIMPLIFYING, ANSWER:
- What is this code's responsibility?
- What calls it? What does it call?
- What are the edge cases and error paths?
- Are there tests that define the expected behavior?
- Why might it have been written this way? (Performance? Platform constraint? Historical reason?)
- Check git blame: what was the original context for this code?
```

If you can't answer these, you're not ready to simplify. Read more context first.

### Step 2: Identify Simplification Opportunities

Scan for these patterns — each one is a concrete signal, not a vague smell:

**Structural complexity:**

| Pattern | Signal | Simplification |
|---------|--------|----------------|
| Deep nesting (3+ levels) | Hard to follow control flow | Extract conditions into guard clauses or helper functions |
| Long functions (50+ lines) | Multiple responsibilities | Split into focused functions with descriptive names |
| Nested ternaries | Requires mental stack to parse | Replace with if/else chains, switch, or lookup objects |
| Boolean parameter flags | `doThing(true, false, true)` | Replace with options objects or separate functions |
| Repeated conditionals | Same `if` check in multiple places | Extract to a well-named predicate function |

**Naming and readability:**

| Pattern | Signal | Simplification |
|---------|--------|----------------|
| Generic names | `data`, `result`, `temp`, `val`, `item` | Rename to describe the content: `userProfile`, `validationErrors` |
| Abbreviated names | `usr`, `cfg`, `btn`, `evt` | Use full words unless the abbreviation is universal (`id`, `url`, `api`) |
| Misleading names | Function named `get` that also mutates state | Rename to reflect actual behavior |
| Comments explaining "what" | `// increment counter` above `count++` | Delete the comment — the code is clear enough |
| Comments explaining "why" | `// Retry because the API is flaky under load` | Keep these — they carry intent the code can't express |

**Redundancy:**

| Pattern | Signal | Simplification |
|---------|--------|----------------|
| Duplicated logic | Same 5+ lines in multiple places | Extract to a shared function |
| Dead code | Unreachable branches, unused variables, commented-out blocks | Suggest removal only after confirming it is unreachable, non-public, and candidate-owned |
| Unnecessary abstractions | Wrapper that adds no value | Inline the wrapper, call the underlying function directly |
| Over-engineered patterns | Factory-for-a-factory, strategy-with-one-strategy | Replace with the simple direct approach |
| Redundant type assertions | Casting to a type that's already inferred | Remove the assertion |

### Step 3: Evaluate Candidates Incrementally

Evaluate one simplification candidate at a time against the clean materialization. This skill does
not apply edits. The parent or author decides whether to apply an accepted candidate to the current
worktree, then reruns affected reviews against the resulting tree.

```
FOR EACH SIMPLIFICATION CANDIDATE:
1. Describe the proposed change and the behavior it must preserve
2. Name the focused verification that would prove equivalence
3. Check the candidate against project contracts, conventions, and edge cases
4. Report the candidate, evidence, and any uncertainty to the parent or author
```

Do not batch multiple unverified candidates into one report. If equivalence cannot be established,
report the uncertainty and do not recommend the change.

**The Rule of 500:** If a refactoring would touch more than 500 lines, invest in automation (codemods, sed scripts, AST transforms) rather than making the changes by hand. Manual edits at that scale are error-prone and exhausting to review.

### Step 4: Verify the Result

After all simplifications, step back and evaluate the whole:

```
COMPARE BEFORE AND AFTER:
- Is the simplified version genuinely easier to understand?
- Did you introduce any new patterns inconsistent with the codebase?
- Is the diff clean and reviewable?
- Would a teammate approve this change?
```

If the proposed simplification is harder to understand or review, do not recommend it. Not every simplification attempt succeeds.

## Language-Specific Guidance

### TypeScript / JavaScript

Do not remove an `async` boundary merely to reduce syntax: it can change error timing, stack
behavior, thenable handling, or the public contract. Treat that as an unsafe candidate unless the
project proves those properties equivalent.

```typescript
// SIMPLIFY: Redundant boolean return
// Before
function isValid(input: string): boolean {
  if (input.length > 0 && input.length < 100) {
    return true;
  }
  return false;
}
// After
function isValid(input: string): boolean {
  return input.length > 0 && input.length < 100;
}
```

### Python

```python
# SIMPLIFY: Nested conditionals with early return
# Before
def process(data):
    if data is not None:
        if data.is_valid():
            if data.has_permission():
                return do_work(data)
            else:
                raise PermissionError("No permission")
        else:
            raise ValueError("Invalid data")
    else:
        raise TypeError("Data is None")
# After
def process(data):
    if data is None:
        raise TypeError("Data is None")
    if not data.is_valid():
        raise ValueError("Invalid data")
    if not data.has_permission():
        raise PermissionError("No permission")
    return do_work(data)
```

### React / JSX

```tsx
// SIMPLIFY: Verbose conditional rendering
// Before
function UserBadge({ user }: Props) {
  if (user.isAdmin) {
    return <Badge variant="admin">Admin</Badge>;
  } else {
    return <Badge variant="default">User</Badge>;
  }
}
// After
function UserBadge({ user }: Props) {
  const isAdmin = user.isAdmin;
  const variant = isAdmin ? 'admin' : 'default';
  const label = isAdmin ? 'Admin' : 'User';
  return <Badge variant={variant}>{label}</Badge>;
}

// SIMPLIFY: Prop drilling through intermediate components
// Before — consider whether context or composition solves this better.
// This is a judgment call — flag it, don't auto-refactor.
```

## Common Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "It's working, no need to touch it" | Working code that's hard to read will be hard to fix when it breaks. Simplifying now saves time on every future change. |
| "Fewer lines is always simpler" | A 1-line nested ternary is not simpler than a 5-line if/else. Simplicity is about comprehension speed, not line count. |
| "I'll just quickly simplify this unrelated code too" | Unscoped simplification creates noisy diffs and risks regressions in code you didn't intend to change. Stay focused. |
| "The types make it self-documenting" | Types document structure, not intent. A well-named function explains *why* better than a type signature explains *what*. |
| "This abstraction might be useful later" | Don't preserve speculative abstractions. If it's not used now, it's complexity without value. Remove it and re-add when needed. |
| "The original author must have had a reason" | Maybe. Check git blame — apply Chesterton's Fence. But accumulated complexity often has no reason; it's just the residue of iteration under pressure. |
| "I'll refactor while adding this feature" | Unrelated refactors are out of scope. Accepted cleanup for this candidate is handled by the parent in the current review cycle. |

## Red Flags

- Simplification that requires modifying tests to pass (you likely changed behavior)
- "Simplified" code that is longer and harder to follow than the original
- Renaming things to match your preferences rather than project conventions
- Removing error handling because "it makes the code cleaner"
- Simplifying code you don't fully understand
- Batching many simplification candidates into one large, hard-to-review report
- Refactoring code outside the scope of the current task without being asked

## Verification

After completing a simplification review:

- [ ] Each candidate names focused verification and the behavior it must preserve
- [ ] Existing tests, build, and lint evidence are checked when the candidate requires them
- [ ] The reviewed materialization is clean and immutable; this skill made no edits
- [ ] The report contains no unrelated refactors
- [ ] Candidates follow project conventions (checked against CLAUDE.md or equivalent)
- [ ] No error handling is proposed for removal without equivalence evidence
- [ ] Uncertain dead-code candidates are left in place, recorded, and escalated
- [ ] A teammate or review agent would approve each accepted candidate as a net improvement
